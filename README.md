# chatbot_basic

This is my first NLP project and I am very happy to share it with the open source community so that some beginner like me can benefit through it :)

The chatbot is a basic sales chatbot and the intents are basic ones. Feel free to edit the contents and re train with the same code to get the desired results.

Guide:-
1) Create a new environment on your system with a desired name with the text file given in code conda env "create --file bio-env.txt"
2) Once the installation is over go over the intents.json file
3) read the categories I have created and look for what more or different categories do you require and change accordingly
4) Go over to the train.py file and run it
5) Once your model is trained run chat.py file

Woah!! Your chatbot is there for you in the command prompt

The trainnig code uses NLTK package and Pytorch and the structure is a basic one

If you have any doubts simply look through the documentation of NLTK and Pytorch

Lastly, to run the train.py file you need to downlaod punkt once so keep that in mind. If you have any suggestion feel free to reach out to me :))
